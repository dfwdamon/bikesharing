# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
This project analyzed a dataset of the CitiBike brand bike-sharing service in New York City, in order to support a business proposal for a potential new bike-sharing company. 

## Results
The results of the analysis are shown below with graphics for each of five 
assessments of the bike-sharing service. The dataset was isolated to the August 2019 time periods for all CitiBike activities in the New York City Manhattan region.

### Tableau Public Link

## Summary
The following high-level results of the assessment with suggestions are listed below.
* The majroity of rides are 5 to 20 minutes in length. 
* Female rides are longer in length (8-30 minutes) and this suggests a higher per rider revenue.
* A majority of riders are male and that most of the riders are annual subscribers
* Peak ridership trends during the AM and PM weekday communiting periods. 
* Wednesday ridership is lower all day,  especialy after 9AM.

### Suggestions
Based on these assessments and findings, the the following suggestions should be considered key decision support points:
* There is a large number or rides under 5 minutes which should be investigated further and adjustments determined.
* Increasing female rides which trend longer in ride time, could help increase revenue with more longer bookings.
* Offer incentives on subscritions to increase the overall rate and widen the gender coverage. 

Recommended Additional Visualizations: 
* Compare the number of trips bewteen different months to understand how ridership changes seasonally.
* Detailed trip locations assessments to show gaps in availability and to balance usage.
