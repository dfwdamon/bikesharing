# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
This project analyzed a dataset of the CitiBike brand bike-sharing service in New York City, in order to support a business proposal for a potential new bike-sharing company. 

## Results
The results of the analysis are shown below with graphics for each of five 
assessments of the bike-sharing service. The dataset was isolated to the August 2019 time periods for all CitiBike activities in the New York City Manhattan region.

### Tableau Public Link
The following public link contains the resultant graphics of each assesment.

### Checkout Times for Users
Nearly all bikes are checked out for less than an hour at a time, with most rides lasting about 5 minutes.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Male and female riders share similar trends when checking out bikes based on day/time. Unknown may not have enough data to identify trends.

## Summary
Viewing the above visualizations, we find: 
* A majority of users are male and that most of the riders are annual subscribers
* Peak riding hours are typically during workweek commuting hours and midday during the weekends when riders are more likely to be riding for leisure. 
* Though the map will look different for Des Moines, we can see from the map of starting locations, that most bikes are checked out in more highly populated areas like downtown or near tourist attractions.

Based on these findings, the bike app for Des Moines should:
* Focus on marketing to male riders and offering incentives for subscription. 
* We can also reccomend placing more bikes and docking stations near downtown areas, office buildings, and tourist attractions since CitiBike in New York appears to be used primarily for commuting and/or sightseeing.

Recommended Additional Visualizations: 
* A comparison of the number of trips bewteen different months to understand how ridership changes seasonally.
* Trips by weekday by age group
